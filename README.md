# Ddkeyboard

Ddkeyboard is a small project showing how to create a virtual keyboard on Delphi 
for Windows machines. I created this project for my website about Delphi (www.dicasdelphi.com.br).
The keyboard is not complete because it can be used as an exercise for Delphi developers 
learn how to create such application. All the tips relate how to implemente new keyboard keys are 
described on the code and on the link bellow. Feel free to use it just keep de source.
